JdbcCursorItemReader you read all the records from the database, you hold them in memory and you go up and down the result set by using 
a cursor (a cursor points to the current row of data). When a user changes page you don't read the data from the database again.

JdbcPagingItemReader you read chunks of records from the database. But when the user changes page you issue another query and read the data again.

First approach: You consume more memory but it's faster.
